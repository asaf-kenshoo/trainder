Crystal Clear Beach Glow Tan Drops Getting a healthy tan, without risking your health or aging your skin prematurely, has always been a fine balance, but now you can tip that balance in your favor by choosing the healthy alternative to a day in the sun. From a beautiful golden glow to a deeper shade the choice is entirely yours, simply mix 1, 2 or 3 drops with your normal moisturizer or night cream. Vary the number of drops to achieve your desired tan shade. Coconut oil has also been added to these luxurious drops to ensure the skin is kept beautifully soft and supple. Can be used for both face & body. These Tanning Drops stimulate the melanin synthesis in the skin to promote a longer lasting finer color tone. They contain Biotechnological ingredients obtained from raw plant materials to greatly enhance their activity.

Its heritage is from our professional salon treatments and 10 minute glow is clinically proven to treat spot prone skin. Available in 25mL & 100 mL Crystal Clear Crystal Face & Body Polish Refine, Smooth and Resurface. Exfoliation is key to clear glowing skin because as we age the dead skin cells become more compact and the body is slower to shed skin cells and generate new ones. Regular exfoliation allows the removal of that build up and allows a fresher skin to emerge but also allows better permeability of your moisturizer to be more effective rather than simply sit on the surface. Crystal Clear Face & Body polish includes super exfoliation and polishing actives such as fine micro-crystals from the precious stone Ruby, natural sea salt and acacia honey as it is rich in minerals including, zinc, iron, potassium, copper as well as Vitamin C to slough away the build up of dead skin cells while buffing and polishing for a beautiful radiant glow.

		"Description": "Size: 0.5 Ounce Product Description This triple exfoliating treatment detoxifies like a mud mask while simultaneously breaking the bonds that bind dead cells into a dulling surface layer, to reveal more visibly smooth skin. In this innovative formula, Dr. Sebagh has combined three of the best at-home exfoliators (glycolic acid, papaya enzymes and silica beads) to reveal smoother, glowing, more supple-looking skin. Glycolic Acid , derived from sugar cane, is a fruit acid designed to remove dead cells from dermis surface layers. Silica , an exfoliant, helps resurface the skin with micro-beads that scrub away debris. Melon Extract , a powerful antioxidant SOD (Superoxide Dismutase), helps to fight future damage from free radicals. Lactic Acid , an alpha hydroxy acid, also removes dead cells from the surface layer of the skin. Papain , a papaya enzyme, facilitates better exfoliation and allows glycolic and lactic acid to do their jobs more effectively and efficiently. And, Illite, Montmorillonite, Kaolin, and Calcite , form a rich French clay that detoxifies and purifies the pores. Exfoliation is essential to maximizing your visible skincare results. Proper exfoliation also allows all your Meaningful Beauty products to work more effectively.

This luxurious face scrub contains our exclusive TruFirm complex designed to help visually repair, firm and rejuvenate dry, aging skin on the face. It is developed to promote healthy cell turnover and revive the appearance of dull, dry wrinkly skin. The Crepe Erase Refining Facial Scrub preps, renews and nourishes aged, crépey-looking skin to help reveal the smoother, brighter, younger-looking skin beneath. Meet the secret ingredient in the Crépe Erase family: TruFirm Complex. This breakthrough blend of essential phytonutrients works together to help protect skin's essential structure. In other words, it works to target the side effects of aging and UV damage.

With sun damage being the #1 cause of premature skin aging, Dr. Kaplan formulated this daytime moisturizer with a physical sunscreen of 7% Titanium Dioxide to provide SPF 30 sun protection. The particles are finely micronized so it leaves no messy white residue on the skin. In addition, the Daily Moisture SPF 30 Concentrate contains SmartVector UV. Sunscreens begin to breakdown immediately upon contact with skin, which is why it needs to be reapplied every three to four hours. Dr. Kaplan saw that most of patients applied their sunscreen during their morning skin care regimen, but did not actually go outside until late morning or midday to run errands or for lunch. SmartVector UV maintains the integrity of the sunscreen until you are actually exposed to UV rays, giving you longer lasting sun protection. Brand Story Created by world-renowned Beverly Hills Dermatologist, Stuart Kaplan, MD, every KAPLAN MD product is formulated with the world’s most powerful anti-aging peptides and plant extracts for truly efficacious results.",

		"Brand": "ALCHIMIE FOREVER",
		"Description": "Alchimie Forever Origin Story Dr. Luigi L. Polla opened his dermatology practice in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1986, and was the first dermatologist to offer pulsed dye laser technology to treat children suffering from Port Wine Stains and hemangiomas. Parents brought their children from near and far to have him erase these debilitating birthmarks, an endeavor that required numerous treatments over a period of months, sometimes years. The laser treatments created heat and discomfort, redness and inflammation, and a burning sensation. And if there is something Dr. Polla cannot stand, it is a child in pain. He needed a product to help make them feel better – to help heal their skin. Not finding the right product, he created his own “recipe.” He would send his patients’ parents to a neighborhood pharmacy with a compounding prescription, the pharmacist would whip up a magical product in little white jars right there and then, and the child would stop crying. The prescription was for what is known today as our Kantic Brightening moisture mask. This compounded product, meant to help heal the kids’ skin post procedure, smelled so good that the mothers ended up also using it, and asking for more at the follow-up appointment: “it makes my skin glow,” they would say. For their convenience, Dr. Polla ended up “pre-making” the product. Long before this mask had a name, it had a loyal following. Long before we had a brand, we had skin care solutions. Long before we had a business, we had a mission. Advanced retinol serum Looking to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles? Retinol is the gold standard in any anti-aging skin care regimen, and this powerful retinol serum has you covered, with a 0.75% pure retinol concentration. The proprietary time-release technology minimizes irritation, while our signature ingredient, the European blueberry, in synergy with hydrating hyaluronic acid, jojoba, and collagen-boosting red clover, calms the skin and helps to minimize side effects typically associated with retinol. A cocktail of powerful antioxidants including apple stem cell extract, edelweiss, and green tea, further enhances the skin's youthful appearance and defends against signs of aging caused by the sun. Key Benefits Visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles Visibly reduces the appearance of age spots Brightens skin complexion Smooths and softens skin texture Rich in antioxidants (Vitamin C & E) Time-release technology minimizes side effects associated with retinol use such as redness and flakiness Suitable for aging, mature and menopausal skin Ideal for all skin tones Directions For Use Apply a pea-sized amount in the evening to clean, dry skin, on face and neck, avoiding the eye area, once or twice per week. Follow with a moisturizer if desired. For sensitive skin, begin using once per week to allow skin to acclimate and gradually work up to recommended frequency of use. Protect your results by wearing sunscreen daily, such as our Protective Day Cream SPF 23.
